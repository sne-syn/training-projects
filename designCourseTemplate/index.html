                        I've come to talk with you again
                        Because a vision softly creeping
                        Left its seeds while I was sleeping
                        And the vision that was planted in my brain
                        Still remains
                        Within the sound of silence</p>
                        <p class="text-block__text text-block__text--small">
                                And the people bowed and prayed
                                To the neon god they made
                                And the sign flashed out its warning
                                In the words that it was forming
                        </p>

                        Narrow streets of cobblestone
                        'Neath the halo of a street lamp
                        I turned my collar to the cold and damp
                        When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
                        That split the night
                        And touched the sound of silence </p>

                        People hearing without listening<br>
